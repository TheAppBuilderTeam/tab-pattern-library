<p>Tags are used to specify what groups users belong to. When an app editor defines the audience for a list or piece of content they choose the user groups for whom the content is for.</p>

<p>The groups appear as tags and can be removed from the audience by pressing the "x" on the tag to remove it. If a user group added to the audience but will not be able to access it as they cannot see the parent list/lists this tag will appear in red.</p>

<ul class="main__content__block padding__100"  markdown="0">
	<li class="tag">Group that can see this content<a href="#" class="remove"></a></li>
	<li class="tag">Another group name<a href="#" class="remove"></a></li>
	<li class="tag">Group<a href="#" class="remove"></a></li>
	<li class="tag tag--negative">Group with no way to access content<a href="#" class="remove remove--negative"></a></li>
</ul>
