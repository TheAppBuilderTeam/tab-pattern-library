<p>Tags are used to show what user groups can access a particular piece of content and are found within the “audience” tab. Each user group is shown as a tag and app editors can remove user groups from the audience by clicking on the “x” on the tag. If a user group is added to the audience of a piece of content but the users have no way to access it because they are not able to view the parent list, the tag will appear in red. </p>

<ul class="main__content__block textWidth textpadding__100"  markdown="0">
	<li class="tag">Group that can see this content<a href="#" class="remove"></a></li>
	<li class="tag">Another group name<a href="#" class="remove"></a></li>
	<li class="tag">Group<a href="#" class="remove"></a></li>
	<li class="tag tag--negative">Group with no way to access content<a href="#" class="remove remove--negative"></a></li>
</ul>
