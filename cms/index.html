<p>This is where you'll find the design guidelines for the Content Management System. The content has been divided into various chapters that delve into how you should style each individual element,  when and how they should be used (along with exceptions to rules explained too) and their relationship with other elements or content. </p>

<p>If you think something has been missed or you would like to request a guide on a particular element or piece of functionality, please leave an issue in the Github Repository. We (TheAppBuilder Design Team) want to continue to build on this Pattern Library and improve its usefulness to the whole team, so we welcome all feedback!</p>
