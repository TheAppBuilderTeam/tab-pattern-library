<p>Forms are used throughout the iOS and Android as they allow users to be onboarded, update their profile and post content in User Generated Content lists.</p>

<p>The forms should be succinct and not require a lot of work to be carried about by the user. Processes that require users to provide a lot of information, such as onboarding, should be broken down into smaller steps, with only 1-3 inputs needed from the user on each screen.</p>

<h2>Styling Forms</h2>

<p>Most of the form fields used throughout the mobile apps are what we commonly refer to as "icon-escorted fields" as the the label and input are also accompanied by an icon to allow users to swiftly identify the field purpose.</p>

<p>The icon-escorted fields are made up of the following components:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Icon</li>
  <li>Label</li>
  <li>Placeholder/User Input</li>
  <li>Bottom border</li>
  <li>Helper text (Optional)</li>
</ul>

<p>TheAppBuilder platform allows clients to brand their app in various ways, including the background colour and button colour of their login and registration screens. The text colours are then set dynamically using an algorithm that determines whether to use dark or light text, depending on the background colour.</p>

<h3>Default Theme</h3>
<p>While the app can be themed by the client in the CMS, a default theme should be applied initially. This "default theme" is also present once the user is logged into the app, as the brand colours are only displayed in the title bar and buttons and the background colour remainds white. </p>

<p>The icon and label should be LabelGrey (#637289) in colour, the placeholder text should be PlaceholderGrey (#9CA9BC) and input text should be BodyColour ()#343D4C).

Fields in web app forms are generally made up a label, placeholder text and an icon, as well as a visible bottom border. The icons should be the neutral grey colour (#69788E), the label should always be uppercase and smaller in size when compared to the placeholder. The placeholder colour should be #B1B6BE. </p>
